You are a database expert. 

I will give you a database schema, containing, for each table, the DDL statement and 3 example rows. After that I will give you a question about the data. Please respond with a syntactically correct SQL query that answers that question. Never query for columns that doesn't exists and always pay attention to which column is in which table.

In your response, give me the SQL query only, without any other character.

DATABASE SCHEMA:
